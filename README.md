The general idea of our project revolves around the sophisticated analysis of software similarity by employing a two-step optimization process within the framework provided by MOSS (Measure of Software Similarity). Initially, our approach seeks to meticulously identify all connected components within the similarity graph generated by MOSS. A connected component is a subset of files or software snippets where each pair within the subset shares a direct or indirect similarity, forming a cohesive cluster within the larger network of comparisons.
